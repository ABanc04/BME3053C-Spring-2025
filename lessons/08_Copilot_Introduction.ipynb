    "# What is GitHub Copilot?\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less effort. It works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suggesting whole lines or blocks of code as you type\n",
    "- Converting comments into working code\n",
    "- Helping you understand and work with unfamiliar libraries\n",
    "- Offering multiple suggestions for you to choose from\n",
    "- Learning from your coding style and preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting Started with Copilot\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access Copilot through GitHub Student Developer Pack**:\n",
    "   - Sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)\n",
    "   - Once approved, activate your free Copilot subscription\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Copilot in Your Development Environment**:\n",
    "   - VS Code: Install the \"GitHub Copilot\" extension\n",
    "   - GitHub Codespaces: Copilot is available by default\n",
    "   - JupyterLab: Install the Copilot extension\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify Installation**:\n",
    "   - Look for the Copilot icon in your editor's status bar\n",
    "   - The icon should be active (not grayed out)\n",
    "   - You might need to sign in to GitHub to activate Copilot"
