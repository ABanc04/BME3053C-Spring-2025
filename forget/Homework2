# normalize = (given - min_val)/(max_val - min_val)
# 1. Create a new script or a notebook on Colab and copy the list above into the first cell.

# 2. Create a function that will receive an array as an input and:

#     A. Use built-in Python functions to find the min and max of the array.

#     B. Use a for loop to iterate through the list and normalize each reading using the formula provided.

#     C. Return a list that contains normalized values.

# 3. Call your function and print the output.

# 4. Upload your script or notebook.
